# Project Overview

This is the first major project, evolving from a small, humorous game to a fully playable, multi-level bullet hell shooter. The game features a functioning boss, original graphics, a custom HUD, game save functionality, and complete sound design. 

The game has expanded to include various characters, weapons, special abilities, and unique traits for each hero. There are many types of enemies, each with different behaviors, ranging from shooting to summoning units. 

The game also features a PDA menu, providing information about encountered items and enemies. In-game currency allows players to upgrade their characters. Various enemy mechanics are implemented, offering a rich and dynamic gameplay experience.

However, the game is still unfinished. Only the first stage has been completed. Through many modifications, design changes, and long-term development, the game now represents more of an idea and design. Unfortunately, due to the project's initiation at an early stage of my education, continuation is not directly possible at this moment.

Currently, I am working on a renewed version of this project, titled **Infinite Nightmare**.
